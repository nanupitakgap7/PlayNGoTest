# PlayNGoTest

This is the solution for the technical test given as part of the application process for Play N'Go.

  a. it is not specified which cards each player has, and

2. Player names and poker hands are randomly generated from their respective arrays.
3. Since the poker hands are inside an array, their index are randomly generated and assigned to the players.
